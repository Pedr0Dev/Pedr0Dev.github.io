              the global economic scenario. However, when asked if it would make

            >The VGC website reached out to Microsoft to ask if it would also
            raise the prices of its consoles, following Sony. A spokesperson for
            the company said it is constantly evaluating the market and looking
            to provide fans with the best options. Because of this, it will
            maintain the MSRP of its consoles. This is the first time that
            Microsoft has officially commented on the matter. Earlier, when
            asked by Bloomberg if she planned to raise the price of her
            consoles, she said she would not comment. Microsoft's decision comes
            shortly after Sony announced an immediate price increase for the
            standard and digital PlayStation 5 in Europe, Australia and parts of
            Latin America, North America and Asia. In Brazil and the United
            States, there will be no adjustment in the price of the console.
            According to the president of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim
            Ryan, the decision was motivated by global inflation.</span

            >However, Ampere research director Piers Harding-Rolls believes that
            with the high demand for the PlayStation 5, the price increase will
            have minimal impact on its sales. Analyst Daniel Ahmad said
            Microsoft should take advantage of Sony's decision to bolster the
            Xbox Series S's proposal: let gamers enter the next generation for
            less than they would for a digital PlayStation 5. As the United
            States is its biggest market and the dollar is strong, it would be
            able to maintain the cost of producing the consoles without passing
            the value on to users.</span

            >"We were constantly evaluating our business to provide great
            opportunities for our gaming fans," said the spokesperson, who was
            not named in the report. "Our MSRP for Xbox Series S remains $299
            (£250, €300) and for Xbox Series X is $499 (£450, €500)." concluded
            the Microsoft director. Although it does not directly cite the
            Brazilian market, the statement implies that Microsoft has no plans
            to raise the price of its consoles, maintaining the same values
            ​​for which they are currently being marketed. Voxel contacted the
            MS press office, and the company stated the following: “We are
            constantly evaluating our business to provide our fans with great
            gaming options. Our MSRP for Xbox Series S remains R$2,649 and for
            Xbox Series X R$4,349.” Of course, this is also no guarantee that
            prices may increase in the future, but, at least for now, fans of
            the green brand consoles can rest assured.
