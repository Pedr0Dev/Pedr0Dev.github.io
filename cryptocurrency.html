            <div class="title-info">What are cryptocurrencies?</div>
            In general, a cryptocurrency is a type of money – like other
            currencies we live with on a daily basis – with the difference that
            it is completely digital. In addition, it is not issued by any
            government (as is the case with the real or the dollar, for
            example). But is this possible? To explain that it is, Fernando
            Ulrich, author of the book Bitcoin: A currency in the digital age,
            makes a very simple analogy: “What e-mail did with information,
            Bitcoin will do with money”. Before the internet, people depended on
            the post office to send a message to anyone who was elsewhere. An
            intermediary was needed to physically deliver it – unimaginable for
            someone who has access to email and other messaging services.
            Something similar will happen with virtual currencies in the future.
            “With Bitcoin you can transfer funds from A to B anywhere in the
            world without ever having to trust a third party for this simple
            task,” explains Ulrich in the book. Although Bitcoin is the most
            well-known digital currency, the concept of cryptocurrency predates
            it. According to the Bitcoin.org website, maintained by the Bitcoin
            community, cryptocurrencies were first described in 1998 by Wei Dai,
            who suggested using cryptography to control the issuance and
            transactions carried out with a new type of money. This would
            dispense with the need for a central authority, as with conventional
            currencies.

            <div class="title-info">What are worth for?</div>
            Cryptocurrencies can be used for the same purposes as physical money
            itself. The three main functions are to serve as a medium of
            exchange, facilitating commercial transactions; store of value, for
            the preservation of purchasing power in the future; and also as a
            unit of account, when the products are priced and the economic
            calculation is carried out according to it. In Ulrich's view,
            currencies such as Bitcoin have not yet acquired unit of account
            status, due to the high volatility their prices are subject to for
            the time being.

            <div class="title-info">What is mining?</div>
            To understand what mining is, you need to know that digital
            currencies – such as Bitcoin – represent a complex code that cannot
            be changed. Transactions carried out with them are protected by
            encryption. As there is no central authority that tracks these
            transactions, they need to be registered and validated one by one by
            a group of people, who use their computers to record them on the
            so-called blockchain. Blockchain is a huge transaction ledger.
            According to Ulrich, it is a public database containing the history
            of all operations carried out with each unit of Bitcoin (other
            digital currencies are based on this same technology). Every new
            transaction – a transfer between two people, for example – is
            checked against the blockchain to ensure that the same Bitcoins have
            not previously been used by someone else. Those who record
            transactions on the blockchain are the so-called miners. They offer
            the processing capacity of their computers to carry out these
            records and check the operations carried out with the coins – in
            exchange for this, they are remunerated with new units of them.
            Bitcoins are created as the thousands of computers that form this
            network manage to solve complex mathematical problems that verify
            the validity of transactions included in the blockchain. In other
            words, mining represents the creation of new units of some types of
            digital currencies. If more computers are used to increase
            processing power for mining, the mathematical problems that need to
            be solved become more difficult. This happens exactly to limit the
            mining process.

            <div class="title-info">How price variation works</div>
            Basically, the price of digital currencies varies according to the
            good old law of supply and demand. In times when cryptocurrencies
            gain more attention, it is normal for them to be more sought after
            by investors, which increases the volume of purchases – and
            consequently, prices tend to rise. “There are only a limited number
            of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a
            predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow
            this level to keep their price stable,” explains the website
            Bitcoin.org. Because it is still a small market, few cryptocurrency
            operations are able to have a relevant impact on quotes. In a period
            of just three months in 2017, for example, the price of Bitcoin
            jumped from around $4,370 to $13,800. Just over a year later, it had
            already dropped back to $3,500. Quotes, as you can see, can be quite
            volatile.
