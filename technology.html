            <div class="title-info">What is Technology?</div>
            The term “technology” comes from the Greek tekhne which means
            “technique, art, craft”, together with the word logos, also Greek,
            which refers to the “set of knowledge”. Technology is an object of
            constant study of science and engineering that involves various
            instruments, techniques and methods aimed at solving problematic
            situations. According to the Michaelis dictionary, “technology” is:

            The term “technology” came from the industrial revolution, at the
            end of the 18th century, and since then it has not been expanded to
            several other areas, but as we well know, it is within the areas of
            engineering that the term is most applicable. In general, the term
            “technology” has been used within the activities that we can call
            “middle activities”, which are organizational, structural,
            information technology, training, etc. and also in activities that
            we call “end activities”, which are the products, the process, the
            equipment, etc. Historically, we can mention the steam engine as an
            important technological innovation of the 18th century, because with
            it it was possible to increase the productivity scale in several
            aspects at the time. Recently, the indiscriminate use of the term
            “technology” has made the word itself lose its true meaning, as we
            are associating “technology” only with the services and information
            technology sector, when technology is not only related to
            information technology, state-of-the-art cell phones, generation,
            internet and the like.

            Segments such as Health, Education and Security are directly
            benefited by technology. With more efficient information management
            systems, it is possible to observe the rise of smart cities, or
            smart cities, which integrate platforms and different resources to
            promote social well-being. There are a huge number of advantages
            attached to using good technologies. They enable a more modern,
            accurate and agile business, in addition to ensuring that employees
            have better careers and that customers are better served. In other
            words, it generates benefits for all interested parties, including
            stakeholders.
