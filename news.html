            06 tech trends for 2022 according to Gartner
          </div>
          More than a tradition, the trends released by Gartner are always a
          guide on what will be adopted in technology in the following year. And
          2022 will be no different. This year, the list includes 06 strategic
          trends that will enable CEOs to fully embark on digital
          transformation, delivering growth and efficiency to their businesses.
          In addition to positioning CIOs and IT executives as strategic
          partners in the organization. Check out the technologies that will act
          as force multipliers for digital business and innovation in the next
          three to five years.

          <div class="title-info">#1 Data Fabric</div>
          The value of data has never been clearer for digital business
          transformation. However, they often remain isolated within
          applications, meaning they are not being used as effectively as
          possible. According to Gartner, by 2024 the Data Fabric, or data mesh,
          will quadruple data utilization efficiency by reducing human
          information management tasks by 70%. This is because of its ability to
          use analytics to actively learn and recommend where data should be
          used and changed. It is a tool that offers flexible and resilient
          integration of data sources across platforms and business users,
          making them available wherever they are needed, regardless of where
          they are concentrated.

          <div class="title-info">#2 Cybersecurity Loop</div>
          The cyber security fabric is one of the main and most important among
          the technological trends for the coming years. That's because it
          allows the best standalone security solutions to work together to
          improve overall protection. The technology has the ability to quickly
          and reliably verify identity, context, and policy adherence across
          cloud and non-cloud environments. In other words, it is a much more
          complete solution than traditional security tools, which, in addition
          to making organizations more vulnerable to cybercriminals, also do not
          offer a scalable environment. A cybersecurity fabric architecture
          protects all assets, regardless of location, to enable a security
          approach that spans the entire foundation of IT services. Gartner
          expects that by 2024, organizations that adopt the solution to
          integrate security tools so that they work as an ecosystem will reduce
          the financial impact of individual incidents by 90%.

          <div class="title-info">#3 Privacy Enhancement Computing</div>
          The real value of data is not simply in having it, but in how it is
          used for AI models, analytics and insights. Privacy-enhancing
          computing approaches rightly allow information to be shared across
          ecosystems, creating value while preserving privacy. Processes vary
          but include encryption, splitting or pre-processing of sensitive data
          to allow it to be handled without compromising confidentiality.

          <div class="title-info">#4 Cloud Native Platforms</div>
          Migrating to the cloud is one of the hottest technology trends.
          However, “lift-and-shift” cloud migrations – migrating applications
          and associated data to the cloud with minimal or no changes – require
          a lot of maintenance and do not enjoy any of the benefits of the
          cloud. Cloud-native platforms use elasticity and scalability to
          deliver more agility. In addition, they reduce dependency on an
          infrastructure, freeing up time to focus on application functionality.
          According to Gartner, by 2025, cloud-native platforms will serve as
          the foundation for more than 95% of new digital products.

          <div class="title-info">#5 Composite Applications</div>
          Composite applications are built from modular, business-centric
          components. Its main objective is to facilitate the use and reuse of
          code, accelerating the time to market of new software solutions. In
          2024, the mantra for new SaaS and custom apps will be to be “API-first
          or API-only composable”, rendering traditional SaaS and customizing
          apps as legacy.

          <div class="title-info">#6 Decision Intelligence</div>
          In a world of rapid change, organizations must make better decisions
          faster. Decision intelligence can support and enhance human decision
          making and potentially automate it through the use of augmented
          analytics, simulations and AI. Gartner expects that by 2023, more than
          a third of large organizations will have analysts practicing decision
          intelligence.
