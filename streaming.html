              Netflix begins testing the creation of 'gamertags' on the platform
            </div>
            Netflix has shown that its investment in games may not be huge, but
            it is constant. Some users of the platform - in the countries where
            the games are available - now report a new feature that allows them
            to create a specific name for their gaming profile, something like a
            "gamertag". Your real name as a Netflix subscriber and profile
            picture are not shown to other subscribers and players. Thus, you
            have the opportunity to create a specific name to be shown in
            public, in order to make it easier for people to identify and help
            invite to play along and other such resources.

              TVCoins debuts in Brazil with free streaming for creators
            </div>
            The TVCoins platform confirmed on Tuesday (9) its arrival in Brazil,
            bringing a new space option for creators to promote their content
            using a customizable streaming app with no initial investment. The
            service, also available for TV channels, can be accessed on smart
            TVs, cell phones and tablets. Based on the Advertising-Based Video
            on Demand (AVOD) business model, the American company offers
            creators and broadcasters a free, cloud-based streaming platform. In
            it, it is possible to publish content and take advantage of the
            entire infrastructure, already ready, to publicize the work and
            increase the audience. As there is no charge to use the service, the
            project is supported by sharing ad revenue. Another differential is
            the development of the platform, which takes place through a no-code
            administrative portal, allowing for a faster personalized app.

              Disney+ passes 152 million subscribers worldwide
            </div>
            The Walt Disney Company revealed that Disney+ performed better than
            expected during the third fiscal quarter. The movie and series
            streaming service rose to 152.1 million total subscribers. In the
            third quarter alone, Disney+ gained 14.4 million new users - the
            company's initial expectation was "only" 10 million. Counting on the
            company's other streaming services, such as Hulu and ESPN+, Disney
            now surpasses Netflix in total subscribers. Hulu had 46.2 million
            subscribers and ESPN+ had 22.8 million at the end of the period.
            These numbers bring Disney's Direct-To-Consumer Business (DTC) to
            221.1 million total. Most of Disney+'s growth has come from outside
            the US and Canada. In these two markets, 100,000 subscribers were
            added, while "international users" added 6 million new plans.
            Disney+ Hotstar, available in India and Southeast Asia, added 8.3
            million people to that account.
